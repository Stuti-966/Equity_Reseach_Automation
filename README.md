# Equity Research Automation – Mid-Term Report

Equity research is the process of analyzing a company’s stock to guide investment decisions. In practice, analysts produce detailed reports on a company’s financials, industry, and outlook. For example, the Corporate Finance Institute notes that equity research professionals “produce analyses, recommendations, and reports on investment opportunities” so that investors know whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock. These analysts often work on a sector basis (each team covers a handful of companies) and publish everything from quick “flash” updates to in-depth initiating-coverage reports. Thus, equity research combines industry research, management reviews, financial modeling, valuation, and clear recommendations for the end investor.

A key element is fundamental analysis, which Zerodha’s Varsity defines as a holistic study of a business. According to Varsity, fundamental analysis means looking past daily price noise and focusing on the company’s underlying performance and long-term growth potential. The idea is that strong businesses tend to appreciate in stock price over years. For instance, Varsity lists companies like Infosys, TCS, and Bosch India that delivered ~20% annual returns for a decade or more. In contrast, companies with weak fundamentals (like old Reliance Power or Suzlon) have flat or falling long-term charts. A fundamental analyst’s job is to “separate the investment-grade companies which create wealth from the companies that destroy wealth.” In practical terms, this means reading annual reports and financial statements to assess how a company makes money, how its revenues and profits have grown, and whether it has durable competitive advantages.

Varsity points out that every firm publishes three main statements – the profit & loss, balance sheet, and cash flow – and each contains clues. The P&L shows sales, costs, taxes, and earnings per share; the balance sheet shows assets, debt, and equity; the cash flow statement reveals how cash is generated or used. By analyzing trends in these statements and calculating ratios (profit margins, return on equity, debt ratios, etc.), a fundamental analyst can gauge the health and quality of the business. As Varsity notes, anyone with basic arithmetic and an understanding of finance statements can learn this; “a fundamental analyst adds 2 and 2 to ensure it sums up to 4,” regardless of their background.

On the other hand, technical analysis takes a different view. This method ignores the company’s detailed business model and instead reads the “messengers” in the market – price and volume. In Varsity’s analogy, fundamental analysis is like trying a bit of each restaurant to see which food is best, whereas technical analysis is like watching which vendor has the biggest crowd and assuming they must have the tastiest food. In stock terms, technical analysts believe that chart patterns and market behavior reflect the collective wisdom (or crowd psychology) of investors.

As Varsity explains, technical analysis “visualizes the actions of market participants in the form of stock charts,” where repeated patterns emerge over time. Each pattern (like a head-and-shoulders, flag, or moving-average crossover) can signal likely future moves. Technical analysis is therefore used primarily to time trades – determining entry and exit points – rather than to decide which companies are fundamentally good buys. Common tools include candlestick patterns, support and resistance lines, trendlines, moving averages, and indicators like RSI or MACD. For instance, Varsity’s courses cover multiple candlestick formations and standard indicators (notably RSI and Bollinger Bands) that traders use to confirm or trigger trades.

Although fundamental and technical analysis seem different, expert educators insist neither is “best” in isolation. Varsity’s authors emphasize that every research technique has pros and cons, and a prudent investor should be familiar with both. One useful strategy is the so-called core-satellite approach. For example, Varsity suggests splitting your portfolio – say 60% core and 40% satellite. The core portion goes into fundamentally strong stocks meant to grow wealth over the long term (at perhaps 12–15% CAGR or more). The satellite portion is actively traded using technical setups for shorter-term gains.

In a hypothetical example, with ₹500,000 total, ₹300,000 (60%) might be invested in established companies for 5+ years, while ₹200,000 (40%) is used for swing trades or options based on chart signals. In other words, fundamentals pick which businesses are likely good long-term bets, and technical analysis helps decide when to buy or sell. The Varsity modules reiterate this balance: technical analysis alone “is not an effective approach to create wealth,” and wealth comes from “intelligent long-term investments,” yet short-term trades using charts can boost returns if combined wisely.

For a retail investor doing equity research, Zerodha Varsity outlines a practical, low-cost methodology. Instead of expensive data terminals, a DIY analyst typically has the internet, company annual reports, and Excel. Varsity calls this “limited resource equity research.” Even with just those tools, it lays out a three-stage process:

1. **Stage 1 – Understanding the Business**  
   An investor digs into what the company does, how it makes money, and who is behind it. Varsity suggests listing key questions – for example, “What products/services do they sell?” or “Who are their main customers and competitors?” – and finding answers in the annual report and investor presentations. Studying at least five years of annual reports is recommended. After this, the analyst should be able to summarize the entire company on one sheet – a technique used by Karthik Rangappa.

2. **Stage 2 – Applying a Checklist**  
   This uses financial filters like gross margin, EPS growth, ROE, and debt levels to evaluate quality. For instance, a gross margin above 20% (as with Amara Raja Batteries) might be a positive signal. Companies failing multiple checklist items may be dropped early.

3. **Stage 3 – Valuation**  
   Analysts estimate intrinsic value using models like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). This helps determine whether the stock is under- or overvalued in the market. The idea is to compare intrinsic value to the market price and apply a margin of safety.

Such manual research is thorough but time-consuming. This is where **equity research automation** enters the picture. In recent years, data software and AI have significantly enhanced how quickly and efficiently this work can be done. AI tools can:

- Scan filings and extract metrics (revenue, margins, debt, etc.)
- Generate summaries of earnings reports and calls
- Visualize data automatically and update models in real time
- Support Q&A formats (e.g., “What’s the YoY growth of this company?”)

Platforms like Rize and OpenAI-based tools now assist analysts by automating many tasks. For example, they help parse PDFs, build financial tables, update charts, and even generate alerts when something important changes. This reduces time spent on collecting data and formatting reports — freeing up time for insight generation and decision-making.

Still, human expertise is crucial. While AI can assist with modeling and interpretation, final decisions still require strategic thinking. Many platforms are designed with transparency in mind, providing source links and clearly explaining how outputs were generated. This hybrid model — human judgment enhanced by AI speed — is proving to be the most effective.

### Final Thoughts

Equity research is deep and multifaceted. Whether done manually or with automation, the core is always about understanding the business. Zerodha Varsity provides a complete foundation in both fundamental and technical analysis. Automation tools can accelerate this process but not replace human insight. When used together — fundamental analysis for long-term stock selection, technical indicators for timing, and automation to handle the grunt work — equity research becomes more powerful and accessible than ever before.
